---------------

[Yes](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

Ideas for future improvements
-----------------------------
- Email notifications when cheap flights to see your friends
- Personalized discounts
- Graph of world's places/airports based on social data. With direct access to skyscanner's database and more time we could build a graph for each user (i.e. node-weight based on friends who live there, edge-weight based on price) and run more complex algorithms on it such as pathfinding etc.
- Take into account more data (friend's relative importance, hometowns (wanna visit the hometown of you best friend XXX? I'm sure you would have a lot to talk about!), recommendation based on places already visited, collaborative filtering, etc.
- Lots of other cool shits
